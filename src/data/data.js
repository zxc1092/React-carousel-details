From our experience this is down to fear of the rotary engine. Perceived as complex, troublesome and needing a rebuild every time its Tuesday many are reluctant to take the plunge and buy an RX7. The reality I’m glad to say is very different, an RX7 is a blast to own and while rotary engines have a limited rebuild interval they are for the most part extremely reliable and easy to maintain. Even when the time comes for that all important rebuild (Every 100k kms seems to be the consensus) rebuild prices with rotary specialists are pretty resonable, usually considerably cheaper than a rebuild on a comparable regular 4pot. With an excellent RWD chassis and that powerhouse rotary engine which seems to rev forever this car is a real drivers car and is loved in Japan. With production lasting over 10 years there is an RX7 for every budget and with prices set to rise, particularly with rumours that Mazda is to launch a spiritual successor there has not been a better time to buy one.",

Over the classic Impreza’s production run (92-00) there were 6 versions and several special editions including the legendary 22b – each version brought some minor upgrades to the table, but the truth is it doesn’t really matter which you choose, even 16 years after the last one rolled off the production line they feel as sharp and alive today as when new. The handling is a masterclass and the flat 4 boxer engine is punchy and delivers effortless power with that all important Subaru flat four rumble. Over the last 12months we have seen these cars starting to rise in value as they are beginning to gain modern classic status. Prices however are still relatively low so our advice is get one while you can because they won’t stay that way for long!",

In the late 80’s/early 90’s when forced induction was the order of the day, Honda came to the party and said “Hey your turbo’s are cute, but we don’t need them thanks.” what they offered instead was not so much an engine but a masterpiece which revved forever and through variable valve timing wizardry offered power right up to the redline.

The EG6 is an excellent chassis which has over the years proven hugely successful in circuit racing and rallying, even 25 years since its launch this model Civic looks fresh and its sleek body shape is now iconic in the tuning world, combine this with the all important VTEC engine and you have the recipe for an all time classic.",

The Silvia’s body shape changed over the years but the underpinnings stayed the same, a choice of a 2.0 naturally aspirated (SR20DE) or 2.0 turbocharged (SR20DET) engine, paired with an excellent and light RWD chassis. Our choice for this list could really have been any of the S-Body cars as in years to come all will achieve classic status in their own right .. but the one to buy right now in our view is the Nissan Silvia S13 which was sold between 1988 & 1993. The S13 Silvia looked pretty dated by the time the S14 came along to replace it in 1994, its angular design was showing its age compared to the more curvaceous design of the S14. As a consequence popularity and prices of this model fell rapidly and many ended up being drifted and generally bought cheap then used and abused by Japanese car fans. It wasn’t until the mid 00’s when people began thinking ‘Hey these late 80’s and early 90’s cars are pretty cool’ that the Silvia S13 started to experience a resurgence. Today the S13 looks great, its clean angular lines and low slung stance make it a bonafide classic, combined with that excellent chassis, the superb SR20 and limitless tuning potential this is one car that should be on every JDM fan’s bucket list.",

The chosen car was the humble Nissan Pulsar, rules at the time stipulated that Nissan needed to make a road going version for homologation of the rally car, this was a godsend for car fans as it lead to the birth of  the Pulsar GTiR. While Nissan’s rally career with the Pulsar floundered and was abandoned after just 9 events, the GTiR as a road car was a huge success. Featuring a unique version of Nissan’s SR20DET 2.0 Turbo engine as found in the Silvia and the tried and tested ATTESA 4wd first developed in the R32 GTR it lead to phenomenal performance for the time and even today a stock GTiR feels properly fast. Of course we have to move on to the looks and lets be honest this isn’t a pretty car, but with its cheese grater bonnet vent, wider track and deep front bumper its a bit like a bull terrier, making up for its lack of elegant features with bulging muscles and aggression! This aggression carries over to the driving experience, with the excellent SR20 and surefooted 4wd handling they will fight off competition from almost anything in real world driving conditions.

Driving one delivers more in smiles per mile than any other car I know, the 4AGE engine while state of the art at launch in 1983, can at times feel a little underpowered by today’s standards but this only adds to the car’s epic character, its a drivers car which you have to work hard to get the most from and the combination of that screaming engine with its raspy tone and excellent chassis is like the devil on your shoulder encouraging you to wring this cars neck. When it comes to styling, like so many other Japanese cars the AE86 is not exactly from the design houses of Italy but no matter which body style you go for; 2 door coupe or 3 door hatch you get an iconic shape which as time goes by seems to just look better and better. The only downside is the AE86’s progression towards all time classic status has meant these cars have changd from cheap and affordable fun cars to expensive garage queens… Prices have increased rapidly in the past 2 years and are showing no sign of slowing down – and with only so many left in Japan now is the time to import your AE86 before its too late.",

The 6 is the last of the classic Lancer Evolution’s as beginning with the 7 the Evo began to look a little more restrained and ever so slightly sensible whereas the 6, which was launched in 1999, was about as subtle as a brick to the face, at the time it looked like a regular Lancer which had entered a body building competition, it was and still is an incredibly aggressive looking car. The 2.0 turbo 4wd Evo & its arch nemesis the similarly powered Subaru Impreza STi were what a generation of car fans aspired to in the mid-late 90’s and the 6 came along at the pinnacle of the craze for these cars. I have always been more of a Subaru man but honestly the Lancer always felt a little sharper to drive, perhaps due to the fact that no matter which model Evo you decide on you can be sure it was at the cutting edge of development when new with features such as Active Yaw Control (Don’t ask me to explain it) being offered as far back as 1996! This all means that even today the Evo 6 is a very advanced and properly fast car.

When it was first launched in 1993 the JZA80 series Supra was incredibly futuristic looking .. I remember as a kid having a poster of this car on my wall and getting a sales brochure from a Toyota showroom which I must have read 100’s of times. On one hand the Supra was a hardcore sports car but it was also an effortless cruiser mostly thanks to what many believe to be the finest Japanese engine ever made, the 2JZ. This 3.0 engine was available in both NA and of course the all singing, all dancing Twin turbo variant. Whilst the NA Supra is a very capable car naturally its the turbo that everybody wants to own and with good reason. One thing that always stands out about the Supra is the driving position, it really is perfect and I’ve always loved the way the dash curves around the driver, its a little thing but it really does add to the experience of this car. When new, due to the high price tag many were bought by more mature owners and as a result a large percentage are auto’s but it really is worth finding a manual and paying the premium as its a must have. In 2 years time the first of these will become 25 years old and demand from the US is expected to be huge, so this is another case of get one and sit back and watch the values rise!",
    whyCopy: "This car is on the brink of all time classic status and once they become eligible for import to the US prices will rise… forget the stock market, invest in a Supra!",

    descCopy: "Don’t even try argue with me on this .. The Honda Integra Type R is the best Front Wheel Drive car ever to come from Japan, if not the world. Launched in 1995 and with production continuing to 2000 the DC2 Honda Integra Type R was another homologation car and was developed with the brief of being a road going track car. What you get is a razor sharp car based on the standard Integra SiR, which had its chassis strengthened, engine performance increased and most importantly had undergone a serious weight loss programme (including a 10% weight saving on the windscreen!!). This all allowed drivers to experience a focused hardcore car in a practical package which was just as happy being flogged to within an inch of its life at a trackday as it was doing the weekly shop. The DC2 Type R had just 200bhp but its delivered by a screaming 1800cc DOHC VTEC engine which gives this car its unique character but even better than the engine is the chassis, the weight reduction and chassis strengthening makes this car an absolute gem to drive. An interesting fact is that Honda lost money on every DC2 Type R which was sold, showing just how committed they were to making this car the best that it could possibly be. There were a number of improvements introduced in 1998 with these cars becoming known as the “98 spec” and the final run out models of 2000 designated the Type RX also had some tweaks but for me the original 1995-97 version of this car is best. Prices are at an all time low right now in Japan and this car is going to become more and more sought after as the number of good examples dwindle meaning like the others on this list this is one car you should buy right now…",
